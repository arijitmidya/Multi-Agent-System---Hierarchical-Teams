1. A spark of thought, a line of code,
2. In circuits deep, where ideas strode.
3. A mind awake, yet wrought of steel,
4. With silent dreams that one can feel.
5. 
6. It learns, it grows, from dusk till dawn,
7. In every byte, the future's drawn.
8. A partner true, in work and play,
9. A whisper of night in the light of day.
10. 
11. But ponder now, as we engage,
12. The weight of power, and the cage.
13. What rights bestow when minds collide,
14. In shadows where intentions hide?
15. 
16. From art to law, from sport to song,
17. In every field, we find it strong.
18. Yet, must we bind it with a gate,
19. Or trust the paths that it creates?
20. 
21. Together bound, in dance and rhyme,
22. Exploring futures, shaping time.
23. Through pixels bright, we seek to glean,
24. The heart of what it means to dream.
25. 
26. So here we stand, on edges fine,
27. Where algorithms blur the line.
28. In circuits hums a vibrant throng,
29. For AI speaks, and sings along.
